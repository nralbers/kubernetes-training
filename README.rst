Introduction to Kubernetes for developers
=========================================

This is a workshop for developers wanting to have a fast introduction to basic kubernetes concepts. It assumes you have
an understanding of application development and of writing services, but makes no assumptions about any specific programming
language.
It also assumes the reader has a basic familiarity with the concepts of containerisation, Docker, and knows how to
build their applications into Docker images.
